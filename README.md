# ArGentum
A simple and rather crappy mobile frontend for the American Girl online store, based off the [Bottom Navigation View Sample](https://github.com/vipulasri/Bottom-Navigation-View-Sample) by vipulasri.

It is by no means perfect, and I do not intend to infringe on AG/Mattel's copyrights or trademarks; this is mostly an open-source replacement for the now-defunct online store client AG used to provide not too long ago.
